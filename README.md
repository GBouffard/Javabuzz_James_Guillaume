This exercise was done during day 1 of Week 5 at Makers Academy. It was our first introduction to Javascript. If you are not aware of Fizzbuzz, you can find the rules on this Wikipedia [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz). We already did Fizzbuzz in ruby; Javabuzz is a Javascript version.

In this repository ping-pong pair programming was done between [Guillaume]() and [James](https://github.com/james-miller).
